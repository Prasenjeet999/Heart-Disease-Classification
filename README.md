# Heart Disease Classification Project

Heart Disease Classification

## Overview

This project aims to predict heart disease using machine learning techniques. We utilize the UCI Heart Disease dataset to build and evaluate various classification models, helping to identify potential cardiovascular risks.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Visualization of results

## Dataset

We use the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which contains:
- 303 samples
- 14 attributes including age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, and more
- Binary classification: presence or absence of heart disease

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Models Implemented

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors
3. Support Vector Machine
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. Gradient Boosting Classifier

## Key Findings

- Achieved an accuracy of 89.5% using Random Forest Classifier
- Identified key features contributing to heart disease prediction
- Visualized the importance of different factors in predicting heart disease

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook Heart Disease Classification.ipynb`

## Future Work

- Implement deep learning models for comparison
- Explore feature engineering to improve model performance
- Develop a web application for easy prediction input
